# Amazon-Lenovo-Laptop-Price-Rating-Analysis-Web-Scraping-Data-Visualization

## Overview
This project scrapes real-time Lenovo laptop data from Amazon, including product names, prices, ratings, and customer reviews. The dataset is cleaned and analyzed to provide actionable insights on pricing trends, customer preferences, and product popularity. This end-to-end workflow demonstrates practical skills in web scraping, data analysis, and visualization, making it a strong portfolio project for aspiring data analysts.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts live data from Amazon using BeautifulSoup and requests.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handles missing values, converts price and rating to numeric formats using pandas.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates insights with seaborn and matplotlib:
  - Price distribution of Lenovo laptops
  - Rating distribution
  - Price vs Rating scatter plot
  - Top 10 most reviewed laptops
- **CSV Export**: Saves scraped data to `amazon_lenovo_laptops.csv` for further analysis.
